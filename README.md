# Discord-Bot
 It contails multiple functions such as getting a random quote, uploading image to text channel, creating text channel,getting image from [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/image) getting a image from input subreddit(the subreddit must exit with correct name otherwise it will give error) with some exception handling. 
 You can use this bot as a meme bot too, just input meme subreddit name, for eg. <code> $gtis dankmemes</code> can get a random meme from dankmemes subreddit(gets differant memes almost everytime)
 ### This is work in progress (as of now), I'll add more functionalities later.
Note: You need .env file in this repo to run this bot, simply create a file named .env, which contains your discord bot api, and (add name of your server(guild) if you like it to be printed otherwise write only api key). You can get discord API key from [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/), create new application, add a bot to it, then copy api key with its permission(keep this minimal).
Have a nice day :)
